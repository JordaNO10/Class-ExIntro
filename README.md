Overview
This repository contains four JavaScript exercises focusing on:

- Logical and mathematical operations
- File handling
- Efficient programming practices

### The exercises are divided into two parts: 
<ins>Introduction Assignment and Module Types Assignment.</ins>

### Introduction Assignment:

**Exercise 1:** Divisibility Check
Write a program that checks a number's divisibility by 2, 3, and 5:

Prints 1 if divisible by only one of them.
Prints 2 if divisible by any two of them.
Prints 3 if divisible by all three. The program uses logical operations to calculate the results, 
converting Boolean values to numbers, without using if statements or control structures.

**Exercise 2:** Prime Numbers
Write a program to print all prime numbers less than 237. The solution employs efficient logic to 
identify prime numbers.

**Exercise 3:** Count Zeros in an Array
Write a program to count the number of zeros in an array of integers using a conditional 
expression, avoiding if statements.

### Module types Assignment:
Copy Lines from Files
This exercise consists of the following components:

- fileUtils.js: Contains utility functions for reading and writing files.
- mainApp.js: Main program logic that processes multiple text files and copies their contents.
- fileText folder: Contains 10 text files, named readme1.txt through readme10.txt.

Note: The combined output will be written to output.txt
