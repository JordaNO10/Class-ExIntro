Overview
This repository contains three JavaScript exercises focusing on:

- Logical and mathematical operations
- File handling
- Efficient programming practices

### Introduction Assignment:

**Exercise 1:** Divisibility Check
Write a program that checks a number's divisibility by 2, 3, and 5:

Prints 1 if divisible by only one of them.
Prints 2 if divisible by any two of them.
Prints 3 if divisible by all three. The program uses logical operations to calculate the results, 
converting Boolean values to numbers, without using if statements or control structures.

**Exercise 2:** Prime Numbers
Write a program to print all prime numbers less than 237. The solution employs efficient logic to 
identify prime numbers.

**Exercise 3:** Count Zeros in an Array
Write a program to count the number of zeros in an array of integers using a conditional 
expression, avoiding if statements.
